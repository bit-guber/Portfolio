### [ <center>28th place in CommonLit - Evaluate Student Summaries by NLP</center> ](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/evaluate-student-summaries-efficiency-lb)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this competition is to assess the quality of summaries written by students in grades 3-12. Paticipation will build a model that evaluates how well a student represents the main idea and details of a source text, as well as the clarity, precision, and fluency of the language used in the summary.<br><br>
